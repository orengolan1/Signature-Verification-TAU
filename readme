copy the codes (.ipynd) to google drive and open them.
download train2 and test2 folders ,from      http://www.upfile.co.il/file/148703331.html   and   http://www.upfile.co.il/file/xxxxxxx.html          ,
and copy them to google drive.

run the codes (we used keras).
the codes implimanting signature verification of the paper :

Learning Features for Offline Handwritten Signature Verification using Deep Convolutional...
Neural Networks by Luiz G. Hafemanna, Robert Sabourina, Luiz S. Oliveirab

signatureVrification_without_change_project_final_code.ipynd

we tried to changed they work and improve it (we add here 2 of our experiments ):

change_size_CNN_signatureVerification_project_final_code.ipynb
dropout_signatureVerification_project_final_code.ipynb 

in the codes you might need to change the path to the location of train 2 and test 2 in your drive.
